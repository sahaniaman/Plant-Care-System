# Plant Care System

Welcome to the Plant Care System!!
This platform allows you to upload images of plant leaves, and our CNN model will identify the plant species, assess its health, and provide personalized care recommendations. Whether you are a gardening enthusiast or just trying to keep your houseplants happy, this tool is here to help you nurtue your green companions.



## Features

- **Image Upload**: Upload plant images to get predictions on plant health.
- **Disease Detection**: Identify plant diseases using a pre-trained machine learning model.
- **Health Recommendations**: Get actionable recommendations for improving plant health.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Flask, TensorFlow/Keras
- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS
- **Deployment**: Render for the backend, Render and  Netlify for the frontend
- **Database**: None (currently, all data is managed in-memory)

## Installation

### Backend

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/plantcare.git
   cd plantcare
   ```

2. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
    pip install virtualenv
   python3 -m venv myenv
   myenv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install flask tensorflow pillow flask_cors
   ```

5. Run the Flask server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

### Frontend

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the React development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   

## Testing Images

I've included a set of testing images in this repository to help you evaluate the Plant Care System. These images cover a variety of plant species and health conditions, allowing you to see how the model performs across different scenarios. Feel free to use these images to test the platform and explore the results it generates for plant identificationn, health status, and care recommendations.

## Usage

1. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to access the application.

2. Use the file input to upload an image of a plant.

3. View the results which include the health status and recommendations based on the model's predictions.

## API Endpoints

### `POST /predict`

- **Description**: Upload an image of a plant and receive predictions and recommendations.
- **Request**: 
  - `image` (form-data): The image file to be analyzed.
- **Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "predicted_results": [
      {
        "label": "Corn_(maize)___Cercospora_leaf_spot_Gray_leaf_spot",
        "description": {
          "Health_Status": "Infected",
          "Recommendation": "Rotate crops. Use resistant varieties and apply fungicides."
        }
      }
    ],
    "image_filename": "uploads/your_image_filename.jpg"
  }
  ```
